Bike Sharing Demand Prediction with Linear Regression
This project uses a dataset of bike rentals to predict future demand using a Linear Regression model. 
The dataset contains daily rental data spanning two years.
The model is trained to predict the number of rentals based on various factors such as the season, year, month, holiday, weekday, working day, and weather situation.

Model
The project uses a Linear Regression model from the sklearn library. The model is trained on 80% of the data, and the performance is evaluated on the remaining 20% of the data. The performance metrics used are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
